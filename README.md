# Game Project: Tic Tac Toe!
This application allows a user to play and track their game of tic tac toe. My ultimate goal is to make a simple fun twist on the classic game

## Planning Story
This is my first project using JavaScript and a single page application. It was both challenging and fulfilling. For this application I wanted to make a simple girly experience that lets you create a user and play tic tac toe. You should also be able to log the number of games played. The hardest part of this project was definitely getting the api to work, along with getting the board to recognize the movement of each space. I am proud of my accomplishments as Iâ€™ve only been doing JavaScript for a month. I hope to continue to grow as a developer and make more challenging applications in the future.


## User Stories
- As a user I want to create a  profile where you can sign-up, sign-in or change passwords
- As a user I should be able to win a game of tic tac toe
- As a user I want to create an easy to comprehend tic tac toe application that is both appealing and simple for anyone to experience
- As a user this application should be able to track progress of the user's games


## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS
- JQuery
- Bootstrap

## Unsolved Problems
I would like to create a feature where you could get a single game.
I also want to create a computer feature that users can play against
I want to user to be able to choose their own symbol
