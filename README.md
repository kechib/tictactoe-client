This application allows a user to play and track their game of tic tac toe. My ultimate goal is to make a simple fun twist on the classic game

## Planning Story
This is my first project using JavaScript and a single page application. It was both challenging and fulfilling. My ultimate goal for this application is to make a simple girly application that lets you create a user and play tic tac toe. You should also be able to log the number of games played. The hardest part of this project was definitely getting the api to work, along with getting the board to recognize the movement of each space. I am proud of my accomplishments as Iâ€™ve only been doing JavaScript for a month. I hope to continue to grow as a developer and make more challenging applications in the future.


## User Stories

- As a user I want to make this program mobile friendly
- As a user I want to create an easy to comprehend tic tac toe application that is both appealing and fun for anyone to experience
- As a user this application should be able to track progress of the user's games


## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS

- Bootstrap

## Unsolved Problems
I would like to create a feature where you could get a single game.
I also want to create a computer feature that users can play against
